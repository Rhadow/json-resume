    "summary": "I am a frontend developer aiming to become a true software engineer and loves coding a lot. While my work focuses on frontend engineering, mostly building SPA with JavaScript, my non work interests range widely. By spending free time learning other computer science related subjects such as machine learning and algorithms, my interest into computer just keep deepening. Building small tools which makes my life easier is also something I love to do on weekend. I am a Canadian citizen living in Taiwan and actively looking for developer positions in North America.",
